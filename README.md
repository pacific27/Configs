Configs

Linux workstation configuration files

Created one System Directory to hold all my config files. Created symbolic links to actual file locations. Easy way
to back up my system configuration in case I need to rebuild my system.

Currently backing up my
.bashrc
.emacs
.Intellij Idea configuration
Plasma_4.colors (custom workstation theme)
